**Abstract:** The first project of the semester, the students are assigned to write a paper on writing a paper. The overarching goal of this project is to teach the students to fully learn how to utilize the useful computing tools we learned in class. Tools such as this markdown file, bash, git, github, Make, pandoc, etc.The paper is divided into four different sections, which is a typical model of research papers: abstract, introduction, discussion and conclusion. This project paper focuses on and explains, in detail, each individual tool that was needed to complete this assignment. Additionally, the paper discusses the pros and cons of the tools featured and the process of completing this project from the author's point of view. Professor Sanchez predrafted the questions that the students are expected to answer through this project paper. After completing the assignment, students will have a better understanding of the tools as well as writing an research paper.
