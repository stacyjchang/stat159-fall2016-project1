###Conclusion

Overall, the project was the perfect learning assignment for students to get more familiar with the tools that were discussed in class as well as understanding the importance of reproducible research. I am now more confident with utilizing with all the programs. Even though this project was not a collaborate research, my understanding of reproducible and collaborative analysis grew more in depth. The structure of the project accurately reflect the format of an official collaborate published research. In total, the project took about six hours and the most time consuming step was setting up my GitHub repository and actually writing the content of the paper. I believe the most difficult and challenging part of the project was to create the GitHub repository locally and remotely, since it was the first time that I tackle GitHub repository individually, However, it was a great learning experience.
