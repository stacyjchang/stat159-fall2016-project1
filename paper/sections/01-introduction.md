###Introduction

Reproducible and Collaborative Statistical Data Science or Stat 159 taught by Professor Gaston Sanchez is a class where student are truly learn how to utilize useful tools, such as Markdown and Git, in order to produce accurate and appropraite reproducible answers to scientific questions. Reproducibility is one of the most important key in scientific finding; it means that one is able to reproduce or regenerate one published scientific finding through similar framework. However, there are alot of problems when it comes to reproducible research. What the publisher published on paper might not be the everything that happened throughout the process of the study. However, with advanced modern technology individuals are now able to collaborate with others remotely and audience can view and understand the framework  more elaboratly.

The goal of this paper project is to teach students how to correctly produce a step by step reproducible research paper. The first project of the semester introduced the various programs that are essential to create such analysis. So far students have learned to use Markdown file, shell command lines, Git, GitHub, pandoc, and Makefile individually. This project requires students to apply what they learned about each tool and utilize them all together to create the finish product. The final paper contains four parts: abstract, this introduction, discussion on the different tools and the process of writing this paper, and conclusion.
